used npx create-react-app . 
This creates a react app in the current directory

ran the following to install json-server which acts as a fake back-end rest api and concurrently which lets us run the app with one command rather than 2 terminals to run the front and back end:
npm i -D json-server concurrently

The -D flag in the above command means it is a dev dependency

then to run both the server and front end use "npm run dev"

installed postman on works machine then created get request which gets the data in the db.json file: http://localhost:5000/logs

can also use the following to get a list of techs using postman get request: http://localhost:5000/techs

Put request in postman to get the name of the tech with id of 4: http://localhost:5000/techs/4

installed the following to format dates: npm i moment react-moment

installed the following for the required redux packages: npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension
